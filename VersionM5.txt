HAPIGame v1.2.0

Milestone Aims:

To get player and enemy shooting bullets, and for
collision checks to work. Also, get a HUD to display
the damage being done by collisions.

7/12/12
- Created a BulletEntity class to handle bullets
- Using a bullet texture, the bullets will be created
	when flagged by either the player or enemy.
- Bullets are created slightly off from either the
	player or the enemy, and based on their Side,
	travel up or down.

8/12/12
- Started typing up collision code in the WorldModel
	update method and the Rectangle file
- Whenever an entity of a different side collides together
	both entitites now take damage from one another.
	If that entity is a bullet, it will be destroyed.
- Player and Enemy ships can also collide with one another
	to cause damage.

10/12/12
- Created a HUD texture and a Health Bar Texture.
- Created a HUD entity which handles score, ammo and health
	and draws them to the screen.
- Now when an enemy is hit and its health is below or equal
	to zero, it will be destroyed.
- Added a method to the Visualisation/Sprite classes to draw
	an updating Health Bar. The less health, the less of
	the health bar texture is shown.
- All members of the HUD entity are updated in the WorldModel
- HUD now draws bullet textures for each bullet in the clip left
- Also draws a score now in its given box
