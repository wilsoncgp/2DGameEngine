	handle the creation of Enemies based on a flag call.
	Also add Explosion Entities.

15/12/12

- Created the Enemy Manager class
- Enemy Manager contains code to handle the creation
	of new enemies, whilst also having a flag to
	determine whether or not a new enemy is needed.

17/12/12

- The EnemyManager will slowly decrease the time between
	spawns until the enemies spawn every tick, for
	a catastrophical attack on the player.
- An Explosion Entity class has been made to handle
	the short explosion animations involved.
- When each enemy is now destroyed, the explosion entity
	will play across one of the strips of explosions
	provided until the animation is finished.
