HAPIGame v1.1.0

Milestone Aims:

To get a fully working black-boxed World Component which handles
numerous world entities i.e. player, enemies, background. with
interpolating values between updates.

26/11/12

- Created a WorldModel and Entity class
- Sent all the data from the main.cpp file into this WorldModel
	and initialized and deleted the WorldModel from main.cpp
	after the game loop has ended, thus deleting everything
	else that is needed to be deleted.
- Created a PlayerEntity class that inherits from Entity
- Entity data is used as protected so it is accessible from the
	child classes to be made.
- Created the render function for Entities, which takes in a
	pointer to the Visualisation component and uses it to
	draw the entity's texture at its position.
- Created the Update function for the Entities which takes in
	Keyboard and Controller data to handle input. The function
	in the PlayerEntity alters the position of the entity 
	based on its speed values and the keys pressed/analogue
	sticks moved.
- Added a couple of time variables to the main.cpp file to restrict
	the updating from happening every frame but rather every
	given number of milliseconds.

27/11/12

- Added a Draw method to the WorldModel class to take all the
	drawing code from the Update method so it can be handled
	seperately.

30/11/12

- Slightly altered the Time code for working with ticks in the
	Update Method of WorldModel.
- Added Interpolation value to Render call, based on the time
	between ticks. Now drawing will take place even during the
	times when the entities are not being updated.
- Used the interpolation value to determine the Entity's drawn
	position between the old and new position between updates.

1/12/12

- Created an Enemy Entity class, inheriting from Entity
- Made my own textures for the 2 entities, player facing up,
	enemy facing down.
- Added the enemy movement to its update class, using an updating
	theta value, the position of the ship looks like its going
	in a figure of 8 motion whilst moving down the screen.

3/12/12

- Created a Background Entity Class, to be used with drawing a
	scrolling background.
- Made a new texture for the background.

4/12/12

- Added supporting code in the Visualisation to draw a scrolling
	background. Using the interpolation value, the background
	doesn't jump between updates either.
