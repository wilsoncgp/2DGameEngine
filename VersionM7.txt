Milestone Aims: Implement Sounds in the game
	And add win/lose conditions.

- I created a SoundManager to handle sound in
	the game.
- I initially used HAPI to load the sound and
	play the sound in my sound manager.
	Problem was, only one sound can play
	at a time in HAPI.

- Decided to look into FMOD as part of implementing
	sound.

08/01/13
- Found a decent tutorial on coding for FMOD,
	used example code (referenced) to create
	a Sound Manager that could play more than
	one sound at a time.
- Added the use of sounds to when a bullet is shot
	by the player or the enemy, and also when
	a player or enemy is destroyed.
	Note: Not the same sound...
